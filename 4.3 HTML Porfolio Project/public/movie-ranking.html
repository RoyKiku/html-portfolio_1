<h1>The Best Movie According to Roy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>#1: Star Wars</h3>
<p>This is the best series of movie which I have ever watched. There are so many attarctive characters, cool CGs and stunned action. I personally recommend the sword battle between Obi-Wan versus Anakin in the last scene of Episode 3; Revenge of the Sith.</p>

<h3>#2: Avatar</h3>
<p>While ordinally 3D movies put emphasis on "pop-out", Avatar uses 3D to describe "depth" of the world. It makes us feel like being at the world of Avatar.</p>

<h3>#3: TENET</h3>
<p>It is hard to understand what is going on from just one watch.</p>
